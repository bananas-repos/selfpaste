This tool uses PHP fileinfo: https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.fileinfo.php

It is not really bullet proof, but it does the job. Everything can be manipulated
to look alike something it isn't.

To expand or reduce the allowed filetypes, edit the SELFPASTE_ALLOWED_FILETYPES string to your needs.
Again READ the README and security info!
