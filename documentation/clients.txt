A bash client 'selfpaste.sh' is available for use in the client folder.
To create this file just copy selfpaste.default.sh to selfpaste.sh and
make sure you change ENDPOINT and SELFPASTE_UPLOAD_SECRET.

Requirements to create a new client are:

    - Talk to the selfpaste endpoint over HTTP(S)
    - Make a POST with multipart/form-data
    - The post must have field pasty and field dl
    -- pasty=File to upload
    -- dl=YOUR SECRET
    - Can parse json at success
    -- message: Contains the URL or detailed information
    -- status: integer based in HTML status code.
    - A normal HTTP 200 without json is not a success
