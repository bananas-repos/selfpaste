With this tool you provide a remote upload space for everyone.
Unless you:

    - Keep your secret a secret
    - Do not use it publicly
    - Do not promote it as a new paste plattform
    - Change your secret often


This tool uses PHP fileinfo: https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.fileinfo.php

It is not really bulletproof, but it does the job. Everything can be manipulated
to look alike something it isn't.

So, here is a friendly REMINDER:

    - Use at own risk.
    - Don't open it up to the public
    - Check regularly what is added
    - Clean everything what you do not know
    - You provide the service by hosting it. Your are responsible for it!
    - Change your secret often

Make sure DEBUG is false for production.
