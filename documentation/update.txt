- update your config.php
- make sure of any special update steps listed below.

## 1.6 Neon
Moved and added settings to config file. See config.default.php
Make sure to add (with default values):
const DEBUG = false;
const TIMEZONE = 'Europe/Berlin';
const PATH_ABSOLUTE = '/path/to/your/installation/';
const PATH_SYSTEMOUT = PATH_ABSOLUTE.'/logs';
const ERROR_LOG_FILE = PATH_SYSTEMOUT.'/selfpaste-error.log';
const CREATE_LOG = PATH_SYSTEMOUT.'/selfpaste-create.log';
