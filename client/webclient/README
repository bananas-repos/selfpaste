The webclient provides a simple web client to add pasties on the go when no client is available.
It is a simple basic auth protected script which will then add the new pasty to your installation.

To enable the webclient read the details in the index.php and config.default. file.
Copy config.default.php to config.php and provide a username, password, secret and the selfpaste endpoint url.

Upload it where you want it and go.
