selfpaste is a small self hosting paste service.
It is not the aim to replace any other well know paste service. It is an experiment
and build for private use only.

This tool uses PHP fileinfo: https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.fileinfo.php

It is not really bullet proof, but it does the job. Everything can be manipulated
to look alike something it isn't.

So, here is a friendly REMINDER:

    - Use at own risk.
    - Don't open it up to the public
    - Check regularly what is added
    - Clean everything what you do not know
    - You provide the service by hosting it. Your are responsible for it!
    - Change your secret often.

# Why json as a response?
In cases the upload is over post_max_size the request will not be "arrive".
Meaning the script does not receive enough information to work with.
In this case we return the start page. Which is a valid HTTP 200 status response.
So the client can not only rely in the HTTP status code alone.
